# dlss-repo

Repository for containing original nvgnx_dlss.dll files which used in [dlss-updater](https://github.com/TolunayM/dlss-updater)

All dlss files downloaded from TechPowerUp and uploaded with their "not executed hashcodes". That means hashcodes are identical to the files you will download manually from TechPowerUp.

After execute of dlss file through playing game, hashcode may change. I added the hashcodes to show that i didn't change any of the files.
